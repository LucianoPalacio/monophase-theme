With Monophase as a baseline theme for Jekyll, there aren't many options available out of the box. Basic light and dark mode support is included. Colors are also provided for your own customization.

- toc
{: toc }

## Dark mode

**Dark mode is enabled automatically** via CSS media queryâ€”you'll find the source code for this in the `_sass/monophase/_variables.scss` stylesheet. If you're familiar with CSS custom properties, you can also use this method to build your own color schemes.

```scss
// Example media query to detect dark mode
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  // ...
}
```

## Creating themes

If you want to make your own color schemes, modify the CSS variables in the `_sass/monophase/_variables.scss` stylesheet with a scoped data attribute or class name.

For example, below we've created the beginnings of a blue theme:

```scss
// Example blue theme
[data-theme="blue"] {
  --body-bg: var(--blue);
  --body-color: #fff;
}
```

Then, apply the theme by adding `data-theme="blue"` to the `<html>` element.
